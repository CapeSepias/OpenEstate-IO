This folder contains the schema files of ImmoXML in XSD format.

We can't provide these files within this folder, because the license
conditions of ImmoXML do not allow us to provide a copy of the original
schema files.

You can obtain the schema files from Lagler at https://www.lagler.de/
After you have received the schema files, place the file called
"immoxml.xsd" into this directory. Correct file names are important!

Also make sure, that you apply the modifications to "immoxml.xsd", that are
documented in the "README.md" of this module.

Afterwards you can generate the JAXB classes by yourself via "mvn-jaxb-xjc.sh".
