This folder contains the schema files of OpenImmo-XML in XSD format.

We can't provide these files within this folder, because the license
conditions of OpenImmo-XML do not allow us to provide a copy of the original
schema files.

You can obtain the schema files from OpenImmo e.V. at http://www.openimmo.de/
After you have received the schema files, place the two files called
"openimmo_127.xsd" and "openimmo-feedback_125.xsd" into this directory.
Correct file names are important!

Also make sure, that you apply the modifications to "openimmo_127.xsd" and
"openimmo-feedback_125.xsd", that are documented in the "README.md" of this
module.

Afterwards you can generate the JAXB classes by yourself via "mvn-jaxb-xjc.sh".
